Biondolillo_2021=["Future time orientation denotes a predominant focus on the future and encompasses motivational factors, such as the value of goals one hopes to attain and failures one hopes to avoid, cognitive factors related to one’s ability to envision an extended future, and expectancies regarding goal attainment. It is shaped by social, environmental, and developmental factors and is a relatively stable and trait-like quality by adulthood."]

Boyd_1997=["The transcendental-future time perspective encompasses the period of time from the imagined death of the physical body to infinity. The transcendental-future may contain goals such as reunion with deceased loved ones, eternal life, reincarnation, the avoidance of eternal damnation, and the elimination of current poverty, pain, suffering and shame."]

Brothers_2014=["Future time perspective can be defined as the perceptions and expectations a person has with regard to his or her future, specifically the extent to which he or she perceives the future as open-ended and holding opportunities, or as being limited and closed in nature."]

Carstensen_1996=["Future time perspective is the subjective sense of remaining time. It has profound effects on basic human processes, including motivation, cognition, and emotion. Future time perspective gradually becomes more important than time since birth. Because goal-directed behavior relies inherently on perceived future time, the perception of time is inextricably linked to goal selection and goal pursuit."]

Denovan_2019=["Subjective time pressure encompasses the perception that the available time is inadequate to accomplish essential tasks. There is some foundational constituents delineating time pressure. These elements encompass the understanding that the subjective encounter of time shortage is imbued with negativity, involving aversion, undesirability, and apprehension, and coalesce around time shortage, the perceived insufficiency of time, and a sense of being rushed, the impression of time passing quickly."]

Holman_1998a=["Temporal orientation refers to cognitive involvement focused predominantly on one of the three time zones (past, present, or future)."]

Holman_1998b=["Temporal disintegration is a process in which sequential thinking is impaired and the here-and-now appears to have nothing before or after it and may seem isolated from the continuity of time. It corresponds to experiences such as feeling fragmentation in the continuity between past, present, and future or feeling a sense of timelessness."]

Lamotte_2014=["The Metacognitive Questionnaire on Time was designed to elicit metacognitive insights concerning temporal distortions, encompassing a comprehensive array of contextual variables that could potentially influence one's perception of time. The final version of the questionnaire measures an individual's understanding of cognitive factors (such as attention and emotion) that can contribute to shifts in the way the passage of time is experienced."]

Lukwago_2001=["Time orientation reflects a person’s tendency to think and act according to consequences that are primarily immediate (present) or more distal (future)."]

Lyu_2016=["We define Future Time Perspective as a personality trait that involves cognitions, feelings, and actions towards one’s future psychological time."]

Mello_2016=["Time attitude is conceptualized as the affective dimension within the broader construct of time perspective. Time Attitudes encompasses an individual’s positive or negative evaluations toward each temporal frame (past, present, and future)."]

Morgenroth_2021=['Metacognitive temporal coping can be discerned through the identification of four distinct categories of strategies. Temporal self-distancing, embracing the perception of impermanence, the deliberate concentration of attention on the current moment, a redirection towards positive future imaginings and constructive recollections of past experiences, and the juxtaposition of unfavorable thoughts and emotions with both downward counterfactual and prefactual thoughts."']

Niiya_2019=["The time perception scale explores the concept of time as either zero-sum or nonzero-sum. The zero-sum perspective suggests that giving time to others depletes one's own time. The nonzero-sum perspective posits that time spent with others can be enriching for both the giver and receiver, challenging the notion of time as a limited resource."]

Pavot_1998=["Temporal life satisfaction quantifies the cognitive component of subjective well-being, and provides an integrated judgement of an individual's past, present, and future life satisfaction."]

RojaMendes_2002=["The time attitude scale was formulated with the purpose of assessing the five distinct dimensions of time attitude. These encompass three temporal orientations (past, present, and future) alongside two temporal perspectives, specifically 'time as duration' and 'time as succession.' The latter two perspectives can additionally be regarded as aligned with the concepts of 'time pressure' and 'event-based planning."]

Rutten_2022=['Work prospection pertains to the purposeful or spontaneous conscious reflection on upcoming work-related matters. This contemplation could encompass purely cognitive elements or carry either positive or negative emotional associations.']

Schiros_2023=['Temporal processing is a complex construct which broadly refers to a person’s ability to be aware of and interpret the passage of time. Temporal processing encompasses cognitive abilities related to accurately estimating, discriminating, and reproducing time, and the the qualitative experience of time passage or how quickly time feels to be passing.']

Simsek_2013=["Ontological well-being can be defined as individuals’ evaluations of their life projects taking into account its past, present, and future components. The construct consists of affective judgments on the life project in its continuity: individuals’ feelings when considering the past, the present, and the future parts of their projects."]

Sobol_2009a=["Three distinct manifestations of present time orientation are subject to examination: hedonism, fatalism, and active concentration. Hedonism is characterized by a concentration on immediate gratifications while discounting both past and future considerations, a tendency to make spontaneous decisions, an affinity for risk-taking, and active participation in a vibrant social milieu. On the other hand, individuals adopting a fatalistic approach towards the present exhibit minimal contemplation of future prospects, eschewing the formulation and adherence to plans due to a belief in their lack of influence on forthcoming outcomes. Lastly, active concentration denotes an engagement in unwavering attention to the 'here and now,' entailing a heightened capacity to discern the unique and exceptional value inherent in each unfolding moment."]

Sobol_2009b=['Temporal orientation can be construed as an attitude encompassing the three temporal dimensions (past, present, and future), as well as a broader stance toward time as a whole. The Time Metaphors Questionnaire quantifies one of the fundamental constituents of temporal orientation: the evaluation of full time perspective or time in general.']

Strathman_1994=['The concept of consideration of future consequences delimits the extent to which individuals incorporate the latent, long-term repercussions of their present actions, and the degree to which these latent outcomes exert influence upon them. This construct encapsulates the intrapersonal conflict that ensues between the immediate ramifications stemming from current behaviors and a discrete array of potential consequences.']

Usunier_1994=["Individuals hold distinct time-related attitudes and approaches to time management, influenced by their individual personality traits and the cultural context in which they were raised. The Time-Styles Scale characterizes an individual's personal subjective perception of time across four dimensions: linearity and economicity of time, temporal orientations, obedience to time, and temporal persistence."]

Vowinckel_2017=["Present time perspective is defined as a state of consciousness — characterized by a receptive, nonjudgmental awareness of sensory, cognitive, emotional, and other phenomena occurring in the present moment — and flow, referring to an immersive experience where individuals are entirely engaged in intrinsically motivated activities in the here and now."]

Webster_2011=['Balanced time perspective is a frequent and equal tendency to think about both one’s past and future in positive ways, which enables individuals to use both the past and the future as sources of insight, strength, and happiness.']

Wittmann_2005=["Time awareness encompasses both the sensation of time pressure or the feeling of time expansion; and metaphors correlated with the apparent velocity of time or its deliberate slowness."]

Zimbardo_1999=['Time perspective is the often nonconscious process whereby the continual flows of personal and social experiences are assigned to temporal categories, or time frames (past, present, and future), that help to give order, coherence, and meaning to those events. These cognitive frames are used in encoding, storing, and recalling experienced events, as well as in forming expectations, goals, contingencies, and imaginative scenarios.']
